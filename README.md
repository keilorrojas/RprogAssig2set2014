# The following function, creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 
# It contains a function to set the value of the matrix, to get the value of the matrix, 
# to set the value of the inverse and to get the value of the inverse.

# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
# makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated, 
# then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets 
# the value in the cache via the setInv function.
